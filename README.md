### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a doctoral researcher with a passion for aerial robotics and cognitive robots. I lead the [Aerostack2 project](https://github.com/aerostack2/aerostack2), a ROS2 framework for developing autonomous aerial systems, where I develop architectural solutions for control, perception, and planning. I am part of the [CORESENSE Project](https://coresense.eu/), a project that aims to develop a theory and a derived cognitive architecture for understanding in autonomous robots. However, my main focus is on multiagent systems, where I explore new ways to enhance cooperation and communication between robots. 

My primary programming languages are C++ and Python.
You can find some of my latest work and projects on my GitHub page.
